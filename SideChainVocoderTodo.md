Apart from the obvious issues (no Mac version, no 64-bit version, etc), there are some other things to do in SCV:

  1. Add bins when running at higher sample rates.
    1. It would be useful with 15 bins at > 50 kHz, and 17 bins at > 100 kHz.
  1. Allow user to control latency vs granularity.
  1. Perhaps add some kind of explicit level follower.
    1. Although the current implicit follower, as part of the linear ramp, works pretty well.
  1. Perhaps turn it into a full stereo vocoder, with 4 in, 2 out.
  1. Update to VST 3.0 routing when it arrives.
