#summary Things to improve in SideChainVocoder
#labels Phase-Requirements

Apart from the obvious issues (no Mac version, no 64-bit version, etc), there are some other things to do in SCV:

  # Add bins when running at higher sample rates.
   # It would be useful with 15 bins at > 50 kHz, and 17 bins at > 100 kHz.
  # Allow user to control latency vs granularity.
  # Perhaps add some kind of explicit level follower.
   # Although the current implicit follower, as part of the linear ramp, works pretty well.
  # Perhaps turn it into a full stereo vocoder, with 4 in, 2 out.
  # Update to VST 3.0 routing when it arrives.
